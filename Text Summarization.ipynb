    "### Text summarization Defination \n",
    "Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a piece of text while retaining its key meaning and essence. It involves condensing a larger body of text, such as an article, document, or webpage, into a shorter version that captures the main points and essential details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are generally two main approaches to text summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extractive Summarization:** In extractive summarization, key sentences or phrases are selected directly from the original text to form the summary. These selected sentences are typically the ones that contain the most important information or convey the main ideas of the text. Extractive summarization does not generate new sentences but rather reuses existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstractive Summarization:** Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that convey the main ideas of the text in a concise manner. This approach requires natural language generation techniques to paraphrase and rephrase the original text, often combining information from multiple sentences to create a coherent summary. Abstractive summarization can produce more concise summaries than extractive methods but may introduce some degree of interpretation or paraphrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "Text summarization is widely used in various applications, including information retrieval, document summarization, news aggregation, and content recommendation systems. It helps users quickly grasp the main points of lengthy texts, saves time, and aids in decision-making and information processing."

    "2. **max_length**: This parameter specifies the maximum length of the generated summary in terms of tokens. In this code, the maximum length of the summary is set to 150 tokens. This means that the generated summary will contain at most 150 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **num_beams**: This parameter controls the number of beams used in beam search decoding. Beam search is a technique used in sequence generation tasks like text summarization to generate multiple candidate sequences simultaneously. The `num_beams` parameter specifies the number of beams to use. In this code, `num_beams` is set to 4, which means that the model will consider 4 candidate sequences during decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **length_penalty**: This parameter is used to control the trade-off between the length of the generated summary and its probability. A higher length penalty encourages the model to generate shorter summaries, while a lower length penalty allows for longer summaries. In this code, `length_penalty` is set to 2.0, indicating a moderate preference for shorter summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **early_stopping**: This parameter determines whether to stop decoding when all beams have reached the end-of-sequence token. If set to `True`, decoding will stop when at least one beam has reached the end-of-sequence token. This helps prevent the generation of overly long sequences. In this code, `early_stopping` is set to `True`.\n",

    "Overall, this line of code generates the summary using the T5 model with specified parameters for maximum length, beam search, length penalty, and early stopping. The generated summary is represented as a sequence of token IDs (`summary_ids`). Later, this sequence is decoded into human-readable text using the tokenizer."

Generally, larger T5 models tend to have higher accuracy, but they also require more computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a general guideline for choosing a T5 model variant for text summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **t5-small**: This variant is smaller and faster but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to larger models. It's suitable for quick experimentation or when computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **t5-base**: This is a mid-sized variant that balances performance and computational cost. It's a good choice for many text summarization tasks and is widely used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **t5-large**: This variant has more parameters and can potentially achieve higher accuracy, especially for more complex summarization tasks or when summarizing longer documents. However, it requires more memory and computational resources to train and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **t5-3b**, **t5-11b**: These are even larger variants with significantly more parameters. They are suitable for tasks where very high accuracy is required or when dealing with extremely large datasets. However, they are also the most resource-intensive and may not be practical for all use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a T5 model variant, consider your specific requirements in terms of accuracy, computational resources, and speed. It's often a trade-off between these factors, so you may need to experiment with different variants to find the best balance for your particular text summarization task."
